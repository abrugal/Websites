# Websites

Airbnb: Website where you would rent a dog. Just made it to learn html and css.

Banana-Party: Website that acts as an invitation to a party for monkeys. Just made it to learn html and css.

GiphySearch: Here you type words and it shows you gifs based around it using the Giphy API.

Resolutions: Website with random monthly resolutions. Just made it to learn html and css.

SoundCloudPlayer: Uses the SoundCloud API to search for songs. Doesn't work for all artists or songs that are on SoundCloud for some reason, and doesn't show all the songs that
are available. You can also add the songs to the playlist and play them. And the songs will stay even if you reload the page. Here I only did the Javascript portion of the 
project, this was part of an assignment in OneMonth. I didn't really touch the CSS here.

Typing Website: This website tests your typing speed. The timer starts once you start typing and ends once you copy the original paragraph exactly. Then your WPM (words per minute) is calculated and you can try again with a new paragraph by hitting the start over button. This uses the metaphorpsum API to get a different paragraph everytime.
